# Automated Installation Script: pyenv on Debian-based OS

This script is primarily based on [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer). However,
additional features are tailored to Debian-based Os.  

## Features

* The prerequisites installation (for Debian-based systems) has been added.  
* Environment variables are added automatically at the end of the installation.
